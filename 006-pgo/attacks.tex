\chapter{Attacks}
A Pokémon deals damage in battle via its Attacks. Fast Attacks generate the
Energy required by Charged Attacks. Every Attack has a single Type, which
may or may not be a Type of the Attacker. Attacks having a Type in common
with the attacker enjoy a 1.2x multiplier, the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB).
Energy is preserved across substitution, but not across battles.

\section{Charged Attacks}
Every Pokémon knows at least one Charged Attack, and can be taught a second
Charged Attack at a cost of Stardust and Candy. Energy generated by the Fast
Attack goes into a pool from which either Charged Attack can draw.
