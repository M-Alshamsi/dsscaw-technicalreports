\chapter{Optimizing for CP}

Several leagues (and some Research tasks) place a ceiling on the CP of
 participating Pokémon.
If CP does not accurately represent a given Pokémon's chance to win, we ought
 be able to exploit this by assembling teams using undervalued Pokémon.
We will see that CP is indeed a very incomplete assessment.

Recall the CP equation:
\[ CP = Eff_A \times \sqrt{Eff_D} \times \sqrt{Eff_S} \times CPM^2 \]
where
\[ Eff_A = ATK + IV_A, Eff_D = DEF + IV_D, Eff_S = STA + IV_S \]
and CPM is taken from Table\ref{table:cpm}.
