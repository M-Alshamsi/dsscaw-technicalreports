\chapter{Unbounded team selection}
\label{chap:unbounded}
Trainer Battles make very little use of random numbers (to the best of my
 knowledge, they only show up when checking for a Charged Attack side
 effect).
Their intrigue is instead rooted in ignorance: ignorance of
 the Pokémon you'll face, the order in which you'll face them,
 their statistics (beyond the static properties of the Species),
 their Attacks, and how their Trainer will employ them.
We've established that Pokémon battle fitness is highly dependent
 on opponent details.
We cannot name a globally superior Pokémon---there is no individual Pokémon
 that (assuming competent play by both Trainers) can defeat all others,
 primarily due to Type Effectiveness.

Does this extend to teams?
At first, it seems that it might: after all, a team's overall fitness
 depends on the entire opposing team, involving still more unknowns.
We will see that the team mechanism actually allows us to mitigate certain
 unknowns, while adding new ones.
Comparing teams is highly nontrivial, and this greater complexity admits
 further opportunities for strategy and cunning.

Change to Damage inflicted by an effective Attack is at least 60\%.
Change to Damage inflicted by an ineffective Attack may be as
 low as 37.5\%.
It is probably worth accepting an ineffective Fast Attack if it
 enables an effective Charged Attack, so long as you actually
 get that Charged Attack off.
Early in the battle, this might trick the opponent into leaving
 off a Shield, allowing a .
