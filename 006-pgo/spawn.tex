\textbf{FIXME}

\subsection{Berries}
Berries can enhance the catching process (\autoref{table:berries}).
Only one Berry can be applied to a Pok√©mon at a time.
The Berry is consumed upon use, but persists on the Pok√©mon across Pok√©balls
  and even encounters (i.e., you can leave the encounter, and if you return,
  the Berry will still be applied).
If the Pok√©mon escapes a Pok√©ball, however, any applied Berry is gone forever.
A new Berry can be used in this case.

\section{Shiny Pok√©mon}
\label{sec:shiny}
Many Pok√©mon have an alternate presentation known as their ``Shiny'' form.
These forms are collected in their own Pok√©dex (\autoref{sec:dexen}).
Shininess is preserved across evolution, purification, and trades.
Shininess is not determined at the level of Pok√©mon spawns, but for individual
  Trainers' encounters.
Two Trainers encountering the same spawn might disagree on the shininess.

I find the fascination with Shiny Pok√©mon completely bizarre.
They're very important to many players, despite offering no advantage in battle,
  and being in no way associated with higher levels or IVs.
Personally, I transfer them to the Professor without a second thought.
His usual culinary magic leads to a particularly shiny feast of harvested Pok√©soul.

There are also special backgrounds, usually associated with events.
That Froufrou dog's uselessness in combat is matched only by its
  capacity for wasting Stardust taking on any number of visual forms.
I don't intend to get into the topic any further.
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Context & Probability of shine \\
\Midrule\\
  Wild spawns & 1/512 (0.195\%) \\
  Team GO Rocket Grunt shadows & 1/256 (0.39\%) \\
  Team GO Rocket Leader shadows & 1/64 (1.56\%) \\
  5üüâ raid & 1/20 (5\%) \\
