\chapter{Orders of operations}
\label{chap:ooo}
A common question is ``ought I perform X before Y?''
By now, we know the answers.

\section{Transforming Pokémon}
\label{sec:pokemontransforms}
To minimize cost of Pokémon development, proceed in this order:
\begin{itemize}
\item Purify (saves costs, necessary for trade)
\item Trade (might get Lucky trade, saving costs)
\item Teach second attack (evolution might add cost)
\item Evolve and power up interchangeably
\end{itemize}

\section{Prioritizing encounters}
\label{sec:prioritymap}
The Trainer must often select between numerous possible interactions available from the map.
Especially when actively traveling, they must be prioritized, with some potentially missed.
I operate thusly:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ignore anything that irritates me\footnote{I expect never again to actively encounter Komala.}.
\item Get anything I want that will otherwise be scrolled off the map.
\item Capture anything I actively want for battle/development.
\item Spin a Pokéstop if I haven't since my last encounter (necessary to sustain ball inventory).
\item Capture any Pokémon awarding more than minimum Stardust.
\item Capture any Pokémon awarding more than minimum Candy.
\item Capture anything boosted by my Mega/Primal form.
\item Capture anything weather-boosted.
\item Capture anything with a Max form I might use.
\item Capture anything I might want for battle/development.
\item Fight Team GO Rocket, if I feel like it.
\item Spin Pokestops (unless my bag is full).
\item Capture anything with type for which I lack platinum capture medal.
\item Capture anything known to be easy to catch.
\item Fight Max Battles or raids, if I feel like it.
\item Assault gyms, if I feel like it.
\item Continue idly depopulating the countryside.
\item Send gifts in celebration.
\end{itemize}
Throughout, I'm actively tossing as many berries as possible, and
 transferring Pokémon as rapidly as they come in.
This is necessary to avoid inventory pressure, especially as
 Potions will be trickling in from Pokéstops.
