\chapter{Foreward}

\noindent{}This text is specific to Pokémon GO, though many details
apply to other games in the Pokémon family.
In particular, it is based on my experimentation with and analysis of
 the 0.361.0 Android release, using decompilation, debuggers, and
 network traffic analysis.
Where possible, I have relied on official Niantic communications
 and my own research.
I attempt to reproduce most claims, though some have been accepted at face value.\\
\\
\noindent{}Changes are frequently made to the game, some of them quite fundamental.
This text documents PGO as it is played in July 2025.
I have not generally bothered to explore variances with historical gameplay.\\
\\
\noindent{}Much of the information herein will be old news to experienced
 PGO players, but I hope that it will provide a valuable reference and central collection of wisdom.
The community established a large body of knowledge long before I
 came to the game.
Still, some of my theories regarding team selection and battle strategy might
  be new to you.
My novel contributions, such as they are, can be primarily found in
  \autoref{chap:unbounded}, \autoref{chap:bounded}, and \autoref{chap:simul}.
