\chapter{Foreward}

This text is specific to Pokémon GO, though many details
apply to other games in the Pokémon family.
In particular, it is based on my experimentation with and analysis of
 the 0.361.0 Android release, using decompilation, debuggers, and
 network traffic analysis.
Where possible, I have relied on official Niantic communications
 and my own research.
I attempt to reproduce most claims, though some have been accepted at face value.

I have attempted to write an exhaustive document regarding Pokémon GO 
 mechanics and strategy.
Much of the information herein will be old news to experienced
 PGO players, but I hope that it will provide a valuable
 reference and central collection of wisdom.
Certain details were established community knowledge long before I
 began to play the game.
Still, some of my theories regarding team selection and battle strategy might
  be new to you.
