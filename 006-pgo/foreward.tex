\chapter{Foreward}

\noindent{}This text is specific to Pokémon GO, though many details
apply to other games in the Pokémon family.
In particular, it is based on my experimentation with and analysis of
 the 0.363.2 Android release, using decompilation, debuggers, and
 network traffic analysis.
Whenever possible, I have relied exclusively on official Niantic communications
 and my own research.\\
\\
\noindent{}Changes are frequently made to the game, some of them quite fundamental.
This text documents PGO as it is played in July 2025.
I have not generally explored variances with historical gameplay.\\
\\
\noindent{}Mathematical sophistication is not necessary to read this book.
A basic familiarity with algebra ought suffice.
I resort to calculus only once.\\
\\
\noindent{}Much of the information herein will be old news to experienced
 PGO players, but I hope that it will provide a valuable reference and central collection of wisdom.
The community established a large body of knowledge long before I
 came to the game.
Still, some of my theories regarding team selection and battle strategy might
  be new to you.
My novel contributions are primarily found in \autoref{chap:unbounded},
  \autoref{chap:bounded}, and \autoref{chap:simul}.\\
\\
\noindent{}While writing this book, I extensively consulted the
  GamePress Pokémon GO Wiki\footnote{\url{https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg}},
  the Fandom Pokémon GO Wiki\footnote{\url{https://pokemongo.fandom.com/}},
  the Pokémon GO Database\footnote{\url{https://db.pokemongohub.net/}},
  and the work of the now-disbanded Silph Road research group.
In particular, all images were sourced from the two wikis.\\

\chapter{Objectives}
\label{sec:goal}
The goal of the game is to consume time and divert one's attentions,
  ideally triggering periodic releases of dopamine into your ratlike brain.
A secondary objective is stunting on adolescents in webfora, but one
  can simply lie, making the game something of an unnecessary complication.
If you've long hoped to be hit by a car, this is the game for you.
