\chapter{Foreward}

This text is specific to Pokémon GO, though many details
apply to other games in the Pokémon family.
In particular, it is based on my experimentation with and analysis of
 the 0.361.0 Android release, using decompilation, debuggers, and
 network traffic analysis.
Where possible, I have relied on official Niantic communications
 and my own research.
I attempt to reproduce most claims, though some have been accepted at face value.
