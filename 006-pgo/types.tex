\chapter{Types}
\label{chap:types}
There are eighteen types, each with a representative icon.
In trainer battles, the types of active Pokémon are displayed
 using these icons, so it is important to memorize them.

\caption{The 18 base types}
\end{table}

Each species has either one or two distinct types, and each attack has a single type.
The attacker benefits if it has a type in common with the attack being used:
 the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB), worth a 20\% boost.
The relationship between attack type and defender typing is more complex.
For each Type, the Attack Type can be \textit{very ineffective},
 \textit{ineffective}, \textit{standard}, or \textit{very effective}.
These are mapped to -2, -1, 0, and 1.
For each Type of the defender, determine the Attack Type's effectiveness
 on that Type, and add the results.
This is the total type effectiveness of the Attack Type on that Species.

There are 324 (18 × 18) total Type relationships, of which 204 (63\%) are standard.
That leaves 120 Type relations giving either attacker or defender an advantage,
 one that can easily decide a battle.
These relationships must also be memorized.


\textbf{FIXME: change to defenders along rows to match bigger table, and because we normally want to see what hits/misses a type}

Only eight relationships are very ineffective:
Normal → Ghost,
Ghost → Normal,
Fighting → Ghost,
Poison → Steel,
Ground → Flying,
Electric → Ground,
Psychic → Dark,
and Dragon → Fairy.
Note that the Ghost/Normal relationship is very ineffective in both directions.
On the other hand, Ground is effective against Electric, Fairy is effective
 against Dragon, and Dark is effective against Psychic, making these the most
 lopsided matchups between single Types.

\section{Memorizing the type relations}
Eleven of the eighteen types are self-active.
Of these, only Dragon and Ghost are
  self-effective\footnote{I use the mnemonic GD, as in ``Goddamnit!'', as in e.g.
  ``Goddamnit, I stupidly forgot Abomasnow can have Outrage, and am now less one Dragonite.''}.
Dark, Electric, Fire, Grass, Ice, Poison, Psychic,
 Steel, and Water are all self-ineffective\footnote{
Fire, Ice, and Water are easily enough remembered together.
For the remainder I employ the mnemonic PEGSDARKASS\@:
  Poison/Psychic, Electric, Steel, DARK, and GrASS\@.
You are encouraged to develop and use alternate mnemonics.}.

Whenever possible, remember two relationships as a single bidirectional one.
No types are mutually effective.
  only one pair of types is mutually ineffective (Bug↔Fighting),
  and only one pair is mutually very ineffective (Ghost↔Normal).
When one type $V$ is ineffective against type $K$, but $K$ is strong
 against $V$, I say $K$ ``kills'' $V$, or
 (if $V$ is very ineffective against $K$) ``slaughters'' $V$.
These twenty-nine relationships must be memorized and immediately recognized.
There are only three slaughter relations: Fairy → Dragon\footnote{Fairy was
  introduced in Generation VI in large part to balance Dragon.}, Dark → Psychic,
  and Ground → Electric.

Ground kills Rock.
Bug kills Grass.
Rock is strong against Bug, but Ground is weak against it.
Bug is ineffective against Poison, which is ineffective against Rock (\autoref{fig:natural}).
Rock and Water kill Fire, which kills Ice, which kills nothing.
Electric is strong against Water, which is strong against Rock, which is strong against Ice,
 which once again is strong against nothing (\autoref{fig:elemental}).

Flying strikes back, raining death from above and killing Fighting, Bug, and Grass.
Fire likewise kills Bug and Grass.
Grass kills Water (it is the only thing strong against Water besides Electric).

Most everything else is weak against Steel, especially
 Poison, which is very ineffective against it.
Steel kills Ice, Rock, and Fairy---if Steel is strong against something, it kills it.
Steel is weak against Water and Electric.
Only two types have no relationships with Steel: Dark and Ghost (\autoref{fig:steel}).

\section{Dual typing}
\label{section:dualtypes}
A species of Pokémon may be singly or doubly types.
It is not possible to dual type using a single type,
 and ordering of the types does not matter.
\[ C(18, 2) = \binom{18}{2} = \frac{18!}{2!16!} = 153 \]
There are thus 153 dual types in addition to the 18 base types,
  for a total of 171.
We could also arrive at this number by summing 1 through 18:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{18} i = \frac{18 \times 19}{2} = 171 \]
Nine dual types are currently unpopulated (Normal/Steel, Normal/Ice, Normal/Rock,
 Normal/Bug, Poison/Ice, Ground/Fairy, Rock/Ghost, Bug/Dragon, Fire/Fairy),
 leaving 162 defender typings to consider.

Dual typing expands the type relation range, adding the possibilities
 of -3 and 2 (-4 is not possible, because no Type is very ineffective against
 two different Types).
It furthermore vastly expands the Type Effectiveness matrix,
 with 3,078 (18 × 171) relations of which only 1,490 (48.4\%) are standard.
Thankfully, these needn't be memorized, as they can all be calculated
 using the base relations matrix.
Completely unexpectedly, the best typings include Steel, with the top 16
 spots all making use of it.

\input{out/dualtypes.tex}

There are twenty triple resistances, five of which are against Fighting attacks.
Two of the typings exhibiting such resistances are unpopulated
  (Electricity+Ground\footnote{Sandy Shocks, Pokédex \#0989, is a Generation IX
  Electricity+Ground, but is not at this time present in Pokémon GO.} and Ghost+Rock).
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
Dragon → Fairy+Steel & Electricity → Grass+Ground \\
Electricity → Dragon+Ground & Electricity → Electricty+Ground \\
Fighting → Ghost+Poison & Fighting → Bug+Ghost \\

Ground → Bug+Flying & Ground → Flying+Grass \\

\section{Weather boosting}
\label{section:weather}
Local weather ``boosts'' its associated types (\autoref{table:weathers}), affecting attack strength
 in PvE (\autoref{section:mbmult}),
 spawn rates (\autoref{section:spawns}), and catching (\autoref{section:catch}).
The game's assessment of your weather is communicated via an icon on the Map View.
