\chapter{Types}
\label{chap:types}
There are eighteen types, each with a representative icon.
In trainer battles, the types of active Pokémon are displayed
 using these icons, so it is important to memorize them.

\caption{The 18 base types}
\end{table}

Each species has either one or two distinct types, and each attack has a single type.
The attacker benefits if it has a type in common with the attack being used:
 the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB), worth a 20\% boost.
The relationship between attack type and defender typing is more complex.
For each Type, the Attack Type can be \textit{very ineffective},
 \textit{ineffective}, \textit{standard}, or \textit{very effective}.
These are mapped to -2, -1, 0, and 1.
For each Type of the defender, determine the Attack Type's effectiveness
 on that Type, and add the results.
This is the total type effectiveness of the Attack Type on that Species.

There are 324 (18 × 18) total Type relationships, of which 204 (63\%) are standard.
That leaves 120 Type relations giving either attacker or defender an advantage,
 one that can easily decide a battle.
These relationships must also be memorized.


\textbf{FIXME: change to defenders along rows to match bigger table, and because we normally want to see what hits/misses a type}

Only eight relationships are very ineffective:
Normal → Ghost,
Fighting → Ghost,
Poison → Steel,
Ground → Flying,
Ghost → Normal,
Electric → Ground,
Psychic → Dark,
and Dragon → Fairy.
Note that the Ghost/Normal relationship is very ineffective in both directions.
On the other hand, Ground is effective against Electric, and Fairy is effective
 against Dragon, making these the most lopsided matchups between single Types.

\section{Memorizing the type relations}
I've found it useful to break the 120 relationships of impact into a few directed graphs.
A thick green edge indicates effectiveness.
A thin red or black edge indicates an ineffective or very ineffective relationship, respectively.

Poison and Grass are both self-ineffective.
Ground kills Rock and Poison.
Grass kills Ground.
Poison kills Grass.
Bug kills Grass.

The remaining interactions don't have any real structure, and simply must be
memorized as they are.

\section{Dual typing}
\label{section:dualtypes}
A species of Pokémon may be singly or doubly types.
It is not possible to dual type using a single type,
 and ordering of the types does not matter.
\[ C(18, 2) = \binom{18}{2} = \frac{18!}{2!16!} = 153 \]
There are thus 153 dual types in addition to the 18 base types,
  for a total of 171.
We could also arrive at this number by summing 1 through 18:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{18} i = \frac{18 \times 19}{2} = 171 \]
Nine dual types are currently unpopulated (Normal/Steel, Normal/Ice, Normal/Rock,
 Normal/Bug, Poison/Ice, Ground/Fairy, Rock/Ghost, Bug/Dragon, Fire/Fairy),
 leaving 162 defender typings to consider.

Dual typing expands the type relation range, adding the possibilities
 of -3 and 2 (-4 is not possible, because no Type is very ineffective against
 two different Types).
It furthermore vastly expands the Type Effectiveness matrix,
 with 3,078 (18 × 171) relations of which only 1,490 (48.4\%) are standard.
Thankfully, these needn't be memorized, as they can all be calculated
 using the base relations matrix.
Completely unexpectedly, the best typings include Steel, with the top 16
 spots all making use of it.

\input{out/dualtypes.tex}

There are twenty triple resistances, five of which are against Fighting attacks.
Two of the typings exhibiting such resistances are unpopulated
  (Electricity+Ground\footnote{Sandy Shocks, Pokédex \#0989, is a Generation IX
  Electricity+Ground, but is not at this time present in Pokémon GO.} and Ghost+Rock).
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
Dragon → Fairy+Steel & Electricity → Grass+Ground \\
Electricity → Dragon+Ground & Electricity → Electricty+Ground \\
Fighting → Ghost+Poison & Fighting → Bug+Ghost \\
Fighting → Fairy+Ghost & Fighting → Flying+Ghost \\
Fighting → Ghost+Psychic & Ghost → Dark+Normal \\
Ground → Bug+Flying & Ground → Flying+Grass \\
Psychic → Dark+Psychic & Psychic → Dark+Steel \\
Normal → Ghost+Rock & Normal → Ghost+Steel \\
Poison → Ground+Normal & Poison → Poison+Steel \\
Poison → Rock+Steel & Poison → Ghost+Steel \\
    \end{tabular}

\section{Weather boosting}
\label{section:weather}
Local weather ``boosts'' its associated types (\autoref{table:weathers}), affecting attack strength
 in PvE (\autoref{section:mbmult}),
 spawn rates (\autoref{section:spawns}), and catching (\autoref{section:catch}).
The game's assessment of your weather is communicated via an icon on the Map View.
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Weather & Types \\
    \Midrule
    Sun & Fire, Grass, Ground \\
    Rain & Bug, Electric, Water \\
    Partly Cloudy & Normal, Rock \\
    Cloudy & Fairy, Fighting, Poison \\
    Windy & Dragon, Flying, Psychic \\
    Snow & Ice, Steel \\
    Fog & Dark, Ghost \\
