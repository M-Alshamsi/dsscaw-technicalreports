Gigantamax forms are similar to Dynamax forms to the degree that they can
  employ Max Moves in Max Battles.
Unlike Dynamax forms, each Gigantamax knows a species-specific attack
  called a G-Max Move, which does not change to match the fast attack.
G-Max attacks of level 1, 2, and 3 have power of 350, 400, and 450
  respectively, 100 more than Dynamax attacks of the same level.
Gigantamax forms have their own visual representation.
