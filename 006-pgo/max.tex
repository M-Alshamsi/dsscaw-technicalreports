\chapter{Meging and Maxing\label{chap:megmax}}
Mysterious energies power temporary and persistent changes of form.
Dynamax and Gigantamax forms operate on the scale of attacks.
Mega and Primal forms are assumed for hours.
Fused and Crowned forms persist until explicitly undone.
\autoref{chap:speciesbytype} has instructions for interpreting form cards.

\section{Dynamax and Gigantamax forms\label{sec:dmaxgmax}}
Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon can participate in Max Battles (\autoref{sec:maxbattles}).
There are no stat or type changes.
Normally acquired in Research, Max Battles, or via trade,
 Dynamax Pokémon also spawn around Power Stops with installed Gigantamax Pokémon.
They have access to three Max Moves: Max Attack, Max Guard, and Max Spirit.
Max Moves have four levels: Locked, 1, 2, and 3.
A freshly acquired Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon has Max Attack at level 1, while Max Guard and Max Spirit are both locked.
Unlocking and upgrading moves costs Max Particles and Candy of the Pokémon's genus (\autoref{table:maxupgrades});
 the amount of Candy depends on the Pokémon's cost group (\autoref{sec:costgroups}).
There are eighteen Max Attacks, one for each type, and the Max Attack known by a Dynamax Pokémon matches its fast attack
 (Hidden Power always matches up with Max Strike).
Max Attacks of level 1, 2, and 3 have power 250, 300, and 350 respectively.
Gigantamax Pokémon instead know a species-specific G-Max attack which cannot change.
Max Move levels persist across evolution and use of Fast TMs.
G-Max attacks have power of 350, 400, and 450, 100 more than Dynamax attacks of the same level.
Max Guard bestows a protective shield (the Guard) on all active Pokémon
  with fewer than three Guards.
This Guard will absorb 20, 40, or 60 points of damage, depending on Max Guard's level.
Max Spirit restores HP to active Pokémon.
The amount restored is a percentage of each affected Pokémon's MHP\@;
  the percentage (8\%, 12\%, or 16\%) is based on Max Spirit's level.

\section{Mega and Primal forms\label{sec:mega}\label{sec:primal}}
\nopagecolor
Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion are almost equivalent; where I write Mega,
 read ``Mega (evolution) or Primal (reversion)'' unless otherwise noted.
Species with corresponding Mega or Primal Energy (no species has both) can take on the relevant form for eight hours.
Only one of a Trainer's Pokémon can be in its Mega form at any given time---Mega
  evolving Pokémon will cause any existing Mega forms to revert.
Mega evolution revives and fully heals the evolved Pokémon, and persists across
  fainting (i.e. the evolved Pokémon can be revived into the Mega form).
Fainting does not stop the eight hour counter.
When the evolution expires, the Pokémon has a rest period before it can Mega evolve again.
Mega Pokémon cannot be used in Max Battles, cannot defend gyms, and cannot be traded while in Mega form.
The first evolution of a Pokémon per calendar day counts towards its Mega level,
  which affects the cost to evolve, the downtime, and bonuses (\autoref{table:megalevels}).
Mega levels are reset upon a trade.
When actively battling in a raid, Mega Pokémon provide a 30\% boost to attacks of aligned
  type by \textit{other Trainers' Pokémon}, and 10\% to unaligned attacks,
  \textit{except for} Mega Rayquaza and Primal forms, which provide the boost just
  by being in the raiding party (i.e.\ they needn't be active)\footnote{Just
  for fun, Mega Rayquaza provides this bonus to Psychic attacks in addition to
  Flying and Dragon. Don't blame me, man; I didn't do it.}.
This boost is never applied to the Trainer's own Pokémon, and they do not stack.
