\chapter{CP-bounded team selection}
\label{chap:bounded}
Several leagues (and some Research tasks) place a ceiling on the CP of
 participating Pokémon.
We have established that CP is a poor proxy for PvP performance, and thus
 expect that we might find strong candidates based on where CP fails.
If CP does not accurately represent a given Pokémon's chance to win, we ought
 be able to exploit this by assembling teams using undervalued Pokémon.
We first take the sorted list of Pokémon developed in \autoref{chap:unbounded},
 and remove all entries whose CP exceed the CP ceiling.
We then select a team using the strategies of that chapter. Since
 that list was sorted according to a general strength function, it
 ought apply in this reduced context.

\textbf{FIXME: IVs are important for lower-tier Pokémon where you're going for high level,
          as they represent a bigger contribution, and each point of Mod is less useful
          than the last}

\section{Team assembly}
Does this extend to teams?
At first, it seems that it might: after all, a team's overall fitness
 depends on the entire opposing team, involving still more unknowns.
We will see that the team mechanism actually allows us to mitigate certain
 unknowns, while adding new ones.
Comparing teams is highly nontrivial, and this greater complexity admits
 further opportunities for strategy and cunning.
