\chapter{CP-bounded team selection}
\label{chap:bounded}
Several leagues (and some Research tasks) place a ceiling on the CP of
 participating Pokémon.
We have established that CP is a poor proxy for PvP performance, and thus
 expect that we might find strong candidates based on where CP fails.
If CP does not accurately represent a given Pokémon's chance to win, we ought
 be able to exploit this by assembling teams using undervalued Pokémon.
We first take the sorted list of Pokémon developed in \autoref{chap:unbounded},
 and remove all entries whose CP exceed the CP ceiling.
We then select a team using the strategies of that chapter. Since
 that list was sorted according to a general strength function, it
 ought apply in this reduced context.
