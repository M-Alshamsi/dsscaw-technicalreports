\chapter{CP-bounded team selection}
\label{chap:bounded}
Several leagues (and some Research tasks) place a ceiling on the CP of
 participating Pokémon.
If CP does not accurately represent a given Pokémon's chance to win, we ought
 be able to exploit this by assembling teams using undervalued Pokémon.
We will see that CP is indeed a very questionable assessment for PvP.\\

\noindent{}A Pokémon's CP is defined as:
\[ CP = \max{10, \frac{Mod_A \times \sqrt{Mod_D} \times \sqrt{Mod_S} \times CPM^2}{10}} \]
\noindent{}CP growth is quadratic with respect to $CPM$, linear with $Mod_A$, and
  sublinear with $Mod_D$ and $Mod_S$.
Remember from our Damage equation that $Mod_A$ is divided by $Mod_D$
 to generate one of the factors.
This suggests that $Mod_D$ is undervalued by the CP equation, which
 would seem to suggest that $Mod_A$ is divided by $\sqrt{Mod_D}$.
We will exploit this discrepancy\footnote{Why would the game use such
 a flawed measure of power? A single stat was clearly desired to cover both
 modes of Pokémon GO battling. Since Raids allow substitution of defeated
 Pokémon, but are subject to a timer, the ability to defend and absorb
 Damage is less important than being able to quickly inflict damage.}.
MHP isn't used in the Damage equation, but knocking out a Pokémon
 requires inflicting some average Damage $D$ $n$ times,
 where $n = \lceil\frac{MHP}{D}\rceil$.
It is thus similarly undervalued by CP\@.
The quadratic term for CPM makes sense from the perspective of the Damage
 equation, since CPM is used as a factor when calculating Damage in the
 case of both the attacker and defender.
Indeed, since CPM is also used to calculate MHP from $Mod_S$, an argument
 can be made that it ought be raised to the third power.

But some of the most important factors in the Damage equation are left
out of CP entirely! The Power of the Pokémon's Attacks are not present,
despite dominating the inflicted Damage. Type effectiveness and STAB
have likewise been left out. Any advantages we can find here can be
exploited without cost.

\section{Strength under a CP ceiling}
We can simply take the sorted list of Pokémon built in
\autoref{chap:unbounded}, remove all entries whose CP exceed the CP ceiling,
and then select a team using the strategies of that chapter. Since
that list was sorted according to a general strength function, it
ought apply in this reduced context.
