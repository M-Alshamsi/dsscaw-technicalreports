\chapter{Trainers}
A Pokémon GO account is synonymous with its associated Trainer.\\

A new Trainer starts at Level 1 with 0 XP.
There are 50 Trainer Levels.
A new Level is conferred as soon as the Trainer's XP meets or exceeds
  its XP threshold, and it is possible to advance multiple Levels
  through a single reward of XP.
A Trainer's cannot control Pokémon whose Level exceeds the Trainer's by more than 10,
  i.e. a Level 22 Trainer cannot power a Pokémon past Level 32.
If such a Pokémon is captured or otherwise received, its Level will be
  reduced to the Trainer's plus 10.
The maximum Pokémon Level is 50, so all Pokémon Levels are available upon
  reaching Trainer Level 40.
Trainer Levels beyond 40 have extra requirements beyond XP (see \autoref{table:xp41plus}).

Reaching a new Level always brings rewards in the form of items.
Levels 1, 7, 8, 15, and 20 each open Special Research.
Upon reaching Level 5, a Trainer can select one of three Teams:
 Mystic, Valor, or Instinct.
Team membership opens up access to Appraisal (see \autoref{section:ivs}).
One's Team has ramifications for Gyms (see \autoref{chap:gyms}) and Raids (see \autoref{chap:raids}),
  both of which are likewise opened by membership.
A Trainer's Team can be changed by purchasing and making use of a Team Medallion.
The cost is 1,000 Pokécoins, and 365 days must pass between Medallion purchases.

All game mechanics, including the ability to fully power up Pokémon,
 are available upon reaching Level 40.
Levels 43, 45, 48, and 50 provide extra Challenge quests.
Levels 43, 45, 47, 49, and 50 open some cosmetic options for Trainer avatars.

\section{Capacities}
A Trainer enters this world with no Pokécoins, no Stardust, no Max Particles,
  no Candy of any kind, no Mega Energy of any kind, and no Fusion Energy of any
  kind.
The Trainer has a Bag initially capable of storing 350 items (not all items
  count against this limit, e.g. Gifts and Stickers).
The Bag can be upgraded to store up to 8,800 items in 50 item increments;
  each upgrade costs 200 Pokécoins.
The Bag comes with an Infinite Incubator, a Camera, 2 Incense, and 50 Poké Balls,
  and thus space for 296 new items.
The Trainer has carrying capacity sufficient for 300 Pokémon; additional
  capacity can be added in increments of 50 up to a total of 10,500.
Each upgrade likewise runs 200 Pokécoins.
They have a Postcard Book with pages for 350 Postcards, and pages can be
 added for 100 Pokécoins each, supporting 50 additional Postcards, up
 to a maximum of 2,000.
The Trainer can carry up to 20 Gifts at a time.

\section{Collecting XP}

\section{Collecting Stardust}

\section{Collecting Candy}
A Pokémon can be ``transferred to the Professor'' from your collection,
 whereupon its soul is converted into a tasty Candy (certain special
 Pokémon, including Kubfu, Marshadow and Zygarde, cannot be harvested).
Whenever a Pokémon is captured, Candy is awarded. The amount depends on
 the evolutionary state of the captured Pokémon, and the type of Berry
 applied at the time of capture.

\section{Medals}
There is a large set of Medals, each of which can be achieved at the Bronze,
 Silver, Gold, or Platinum level.
