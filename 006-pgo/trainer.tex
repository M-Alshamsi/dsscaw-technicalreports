\chapter{Trainers}
Each account is defined by its associated Trainer.
A new Trainer starts at Level 1 (of 50), with 0 XP, no Stardust, no Max Particles,
 no Candy of any kind, and no Mega Energy of any kind.
A Trainer cannot hold Pokémon whose XP level exceeds the Trainer's
 by more than 10, i.e. a Level 22 Trainer cannot possess a Level 33
 Pokémon. If such a Pokémon is captured or otherwise received, its
 Level will be reduced to the maximum allowed.

Upon reaching Level 5, a Trainer can select one of three Teams.
This opens up access to Gyms, Raids, and Appraisal, and is otherwise
 merely cosmetic.
The Trainer's Team can be changed (once per year only) by buying and
 making use of a Team Medallion.
The cost is 1,000 Pokécoins.

\section{Capacities}
The Trainer has a Bag initially capable of storing 350 items (not all items
  count against this limit, e.g. Gifts and Stickers).
The Bag can be upgraded to store up to 8,800 items in 50 item increments;
  each upgrade costs 200 Pokécoins.
The Bag comes with an Infinite Incubator, a Camera, and 50 Poké Balls.
They have carrying capacity sufficient for 300 Pokémon; additional
  capacity can be added in 50 Pokémon increments up to a total
  of 10,500.
Each upgrade likewise runs 200 Pokécoins.
They have a Postcard Book with pages for 350 Postcards, and pages can be
 added for 100 Pokécoins each, supporting 50 additional Postcards, up
 to a maximum of 2,000.
The Trainer can carry up to 20 Gifts at a time.

\section{Collecting XP}

\section{Collecting Stardust}

\section{Collecting Candy}
A Pokémon can be ``transferred to the Professor'' from your collection,
 whereupon its soul is converted into a tasty Candy (certain special
 Pokémon, including Kubfu, Marshadow and Zygarde, cannot be harvested).
Whenever a Pokémon is captured, Candy is awarded. The amount depends on
 the evolutionary state of the captured Pokémon, and the type of Berry
 applied at the time of capture.

\section{Medals}
There is a large set of Medals, each of which can be achieved at the Bronze,
 Silver, Gold, or Platinum level.
