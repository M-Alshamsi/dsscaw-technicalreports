\chapter{Trainers}
A Pok√©mon GO account is synonymous with its associated Trainer.

\section{Levels}
\label{sec:levels}
New Trainers start at Level 1 (of 50) with 0 XP\@.
A new Level is conferred as soon as the Trainer's XP meets or exceeds
  that Level's XP threshold (\autoref{table:xp40}).
It is possible to advance multiple Levels via a single award of XP\@.

Certain elements of gameplay are gated by Trainer Level (\autoref{table:levelgates}),
  and a Trainer cannot control Pok√©mon whose Level exceeds the Trainer's
  by more than 10---a Level 22 Trainer will be unable to power up (\autoref{sec:plevel}) a Pok√©mon past Level 32.
Reaching a new Level is rewarded with items (\autoref{table:levelitems}).
Levels 7, 8, 15, and 20 introduce Special Research (\autoref{sec:research}).

\caption{Items awarded for reaching Trainer Levels}
\label{table:levelitems}
\end{table}
All level-gated mechanics, including the ability to fully power up Pok√©mon,
 are available at Level 40\footnote{The maximum Pok√©mon Level is 50 (\autoref{chap:pokemon}).}.
Levels 43, 45, 48, and 50 provide extra Challenge quests.
Levels 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, and 50 open some cosmetic options for Trainer avatars.
Trainer Level determines the maximum level of wild spawns
  (\autoref{sec:spawns}) and the difficulty of Team GO Rocket
  opponents (\autoref{sec:rocket}).

\section{Team}
Upon reaching Level 5, a Trainer can join one of three Teams: Mystic (blue),
  Valor (red), or Instinct (yellow).
The only non-cosmetic effect of Team choice regards Gyms (\autoref{sec:gyms}), which
  are held by one Team at a time.
A Trainer can change their Team by purchasing and making use of a Team Medallion.
The cost is 1,000 Pok√©coins, and 365 days must pass between Medallion purchases.

It seems sadly impossible to join GO Rocket. Alas!

\section{Capacities}
\label{sec:capacities}
A Trainer enters this world with no Pok√©mon, no Pok√©coins, no Stardust,
  no Max Particles, no Candy of any kind, no Mega Energy of any kind,
  no Primal Energy of any kind, no Fusion Energy of any kind, and no Crown
  Energy of any kind.
They have initial carrying capacity sufficient for 300 Pok√©mon.
Additional storage can be added in increments of 50, up to a total of 10,500.
Each upgrade costs 200 Pok√©coins.
A full upgrade will thus currently run you 40,800 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer has a Bag capable of storing 350 items (strangely, not all items
  count against this limit, including Gifts, Stickers, and the Postcard Book,
  which I suppose are shoved down the front of one's Trainer uniform).
The Bag comes with an Infinite Incubator, a Camera, 2 Incense, and 50 Pok√© Balls,
  and thus space for 296 new items.
The Bag can be upgraded to store up to 9,500 items.
Here again, each upgrade costs 200 Pok√©coins, and increases capacity by 50 items.
The maximum Bag is thus 36,600 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer has a Postcard Book with seven pages, each capable of retaining
 50 Postcards, for an inital limit of 350.
Pages can be added for 100 Pok√©coins each, up to a maximum of 40 Pages
 supporting 2,000 total Postcards.
Such a monster will cost 3,300 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer can carry up to twenty Gifts at a time. and up to 25 of each sticker.
To date, no one has found any use for the stickers.

Upon obtaining four Shadow Shards, they are automatically refined into a Purified Gem.
The Trainer can carry up to ten Purified Gems.
Shadow Shards cannot be collected while holding ten gems, though any extras
 following the tenth gem's purification will be retained (this can only
 happen when receiving multiple shards in a single award).

The Trainer can accumulate no more than 9,999 units of a given Mega Energy,
 Primal Energy, or Fusion Energy.
A limit on Crown Energy is not yet known, but seems likely to be 9,999.

No limit is known for Candy nor Candy XL.
A lower bound has been established in the millions.
It seems plausible that the limit is one less than a large power of 2:
  2,147,483,647 seems as good a guess as any\footnote{If the limit is driven by UI requirements, it's likely lower.}.

\section{Pok√©dexen}
\label{sec:dexen}
The Trainer has ten Pok√©dexen\footnote{``Pok√©dexes'' to the uncultured.}:
  ``Pok√©mon'', ``Shiny'', ``XXL'', ``XXS'', ``G-Max'', ``Mega'', ``Shadow'',
  ``Purified'', ``üüâ100\%'', and ``Lucky''.
All ten start empty, and several start locked.
20 4üüâ Pok√©mon are required to unlock ``üüâ100\%''.
15 Shiny Pok√©mon must be captured for ``Shiny''.
10 Shadow, Purified, or Lucky Pok√©mon will unlock their respective dexen.
Entries are filled in as the relevant Pok√©mon are acquired (via any means).
Once registered, Pok√©dex entries are never unregistered.
If an entry is made in some Pok√©dex, the corresponding entry is also made
  in the primary Pok√©dex.
Shiny Shadow Pok√©mon and Shiny Purified Pok√©mon are registered to the
  ``Shiny'' Pok√©dex along with the ``Shadow'' or ``Purified'' Pok√©dex.

Besides pointless nostalgia, the ``Info'' and ``Battle'' tabs of filled entries
  provide information regarding evolution (\autoref{sec:evolution}), type
  relations (\autoref{chap:types}), and attacks (\autoref{chap:attacks}).
Trainers can place an alert on one filled or silhouetted entry to receive
  notifications when that Pok√©mon is nearby.
Some extreme collectors maintain ``living Pok√©dexen'', i.e. one of each
  species/form (sometimes with extra requirements) in their usable Pok√©mon storage.

\section{Grinding}
\label{sec:grinding}
For me, the joy of Pok√©mon GO is almost entirely found in its PvP League play (\autoref{sec:3x3}).
Others take pleasure from its collection and social aspects.
Either way, you'll be doing a good bit of slogging in order to find, develop,
  and evolve powerful Pok√©mon.
Those willing to spend money can speed the process up a bit, but there's
  no escaping the fundamental cycles of Catch, Appraise, Transfer and
  Catch, Appraise, Develop. 
I began playing on 2025-03-01.
As I write this about four months later, I have caught 20,364 Pok√©mon, of which
  I have retained 441---a little less than 2.2\%.

\subsection{Collecting Pok√©mon}
\label{subsec:getmons}
Pok√©mon can be received from other Trainers via trades (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  but most are captured with Pok√©balls in encounters.
An encounter involves a single subject Pok√©mon, a single Trainer,
  and possibly that Trainer's current Buddy Pok√©mon.
Outcomes (aside from certain plot-based encounters) include capture, flight of
  the Pok√©mon, and departure of the Trainer.

During the initial tour with Professor Willow, you select one of
 Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, or Pikachu to catch.
You will enter the Encounter screen, be provided an infinite supply of
  Pok√©balls for the encounter, and enjoy a catch rate (\autoref{sec:catch}) set to 100\%.

Pok√©mon will spawn on the Map screen, seemingly at random (see \autoref{sec:spawns} for details).
Pressing on them will open the Encounter screen with that Pok√©mon,
  providing an opportunity to catch it.
Encounters are also triggered by the completion of certain Research,
  defeats of Team GO Rocket, Raid wins, and Max Battle wins.
Encounters due to Research can be arbitrarily postponed by leaving the encounter screen,
  or simply not closing the research out.
Leaving wild encounters might see the Pok√©mon disappear from the Map, especially
  if you've moved significantly, or much time has gone by.
Encounters following battle wins are one-and-done; if you exit the encounter,
  that Pok√©mon is gone.

\subsection{Collecting XP}
\label{subsec:getxp}
Gaining sufficient XP advances the Trainer's level.
It is most regularly received for capturing Pok√©mon, but large awards are
  available by other means, and can be the source of a majority of a Trainer's XP.
  \textbf{FIXME}
Using a Lucky Egg doubles all XP awards for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Lucky Eggs can be bought from the Shop (one for 80 Pok√©coins or eight for 500),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.

\subsection{Collecting Stardust}
\label{subsec:getdust}
Trainers pay a cost (partially) in Stardust
  to level up their Pok√©mon (\autoref{sec:plevel}),
  to trade them (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  to purify Shadow Pok√©mon (\autoref{sec:shadow}),
  to teach them second charged attacks (\autoref{sec:charged}),
  to change certain forms (\autoref{sec:forms}),
  and to activate Adventure Effects (\autoref{sec:effects}).
Stardust becomes the primary bottleneck on advancement fairly early in the game:
  Pok√©mon at higher levels require more Stardust to power up (\autoref{table:powerups}),
  but the amount of Stardust awarded for their capture doesn't change.
There is never enough, and one must carefully manage its use.

The primary means of acquiring Stardust is catching Pok√©mon.
The vast majority of Pok√©mon result in one of three awards based on their stage
 (\autoref{sec:evolution}), but a few offer more (\autoref{table:stardust}),
 making them excellent targets for Razz berries.
A Pok√©mon which is weather-boosted (\autoref{sec:weather}) awards 25\% more than normal.
Stardust can also be collected for wins in the GO Battle League,
  opening Gifts (\autoref{sec:gifts}),
  completing Routes,
  completing Research,
  participating in Showcases,
  defeating Team Leaders in Trainer Battles,
  defeating Team GO Rocket,
  hatching eggs,
  feeding berries to Pok√©mon defending your team's Gyms (30 per),
  and from weekly Adventure Sync rewards based on the total distance walked.
5üüâ and 6üüâ Max Battles award 15,000 and 25,000 Stardust respectively.

\end{table}
Using a Star Piece increases all Stardust awards by 50\% for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Star Pieces can be bought from the Shop (one for 100 Pok√©coins or eight for 640),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.
\subsection{Collecting Candy}
\label{subsec:getcandy}
Each genus (\autoref{sec:evolution}) has its own flavor of Candy and Candy XL.
Along with Stardust, most Pok√©mon enhancement is driven by Candy.
Candy is primarily acquired by capturing Pok√©mon: each capture (in any context)
  awards Candy (and possibly Candy XL) of the capture's genus.
Three Candy are awarded for capture of a Stage 1 Pok√©mon, five for a Stage 2,
  and ten for Stage 3.
Pinap and Silver pinap berries increase this award (\autoref{sec:berries}).
Candy XL is necessary for advancing Pok√©mon past Level 40.
100 Candy can be exchanged for a single Candy XL of that same flavor.
Each Rare Candy can be converted into arbitrarily flavored Candy; Rare Candy XL can become any flavor of Candy XL\@.

A Pok√©mon can be ``transferred to the Professor'' for soul harvesting;
  its loss of existence is your gain of one tasty Candy.
Certain plot armored Pok√©mon cannot be harvested (\autoref{sec:myths}).
If a Pok√©mon HOME account is linked, Pok√©mon can likewise be transferred there,
  resulting in a single Candy.
Evolution consumes many Candies, but returns one when complete.

Walking with a Buddy (\autoref{sec:buddies}) will generate Candy (and possibly Candy XL).
The distance that must be walked depends on the Buddy's cost group (\autoref{sec:costgroups}).
Giving berries to gym defenders rarely results in Candy (in addition to guaranteed XP and Stardust).
Hatching an egg yields Candy of the hatched genus, depending on the egg type.
It is possible through Research to receive Candy for a genus not present in
  your Pok√©dex, i.e. one whose constituent species you have never captured.
You'll keep this Candy, but it doesn't result in a Pok√©dex entry.
Likewise, Candy is retained even if all Pok√©mon of that genus have been transferred.
\subsection{Collecting Energies}
Form-changing Energies (Mega, Primal, Fusion, and Crown) can be acquired by winning a raid of that type
  (faster victories yield more energy) or completing certain research tasks.
If a Buddy Pok√©mon is of an evolutionary line where any member of that line has undergone Mega evolution
  or Primal reversion, walking will earn 5 energy per kilometer.
This rate is constant across all species, but the energy is awarded only when the Buddy finds Candy,
  as determined by its cost group (\autoref{sec:costgroups}).
Walking cannot earn Fusion or Crown energies.

Note that Mega and Primal evolutions are temporary, while Fusion and Crowning is persistent
  until explicitly undone.
\subsection{Collecting Pok√©coins (and F2P vs. P2P)}
\label{subsec:getcoins}
Pok√©mon GO is free to download, with optional microtransactions through the ingame
  Shop and the Pok√©mon GO web store.
Pok√©coins can be used to purchase most items\footnote{Event passes generally require cash,
  as does anything specific to the web store.}, and local currency can purchase Pok√©coins.
Interestingly, the ratio of exchange rates for Pok√©coin and USD diverges
  wildly across regions\footnote{It should be noted that use of e.g. a VPN to purchase Pok√©coins remotely is a
  violation of the TOS\@.}.
A one-time award of 150 Pok√©coins is presented upon reaching Level 7;
  a humble sum ensuring that Trainers are aware of the game's spending opportunities.
More usefully, Pok√©mon defeated while defending a Gym (\autoref{sec:gyms}) can
  return with Pok√©coins.
The Pok√©mon receives one Pok√©coin for every ten minutes spent in the Gym,
  and presents these weregild to the Trainer upon return.
The Trainer can collect only 50 Pok√©coin each calendar day, no matter how many Pok√©mon return.
This maximum is achieved by 8‚Öì hours' occupancy of Gyms.

As an example, a Trainer leaves Pok√©mon in aligned gyms at 2200h and 2210h local time.
The first returns at 2341h that evening, the second at 1001h the next morning.
The Trainer receives 10 Pok√©coins at 2341h, and 50 Pok√©coins at 1001h, for a total of 60.
If the first returned instead at 0001h, the Trainer would receive 12 Pok√©coins at 0001h,
  and 38 Pok√©coins at 1001h, for a total of 50.
Note that the second case earns less, despite greater occupancy time.
By regularly taking Gyms, with a little luck a Trainer can accumulate 350 free Pok√©coins each week.

Is it possible to play PGO at a high level without spending money?
The serious collector-style Trainer has costs for storage and raiding (\autoref{sec:raids})
  that can't easily be met by 350 Pok√©coins per week, especially
  in pursuit of Shiny Pok√©mon (\autoref{sec:shiny}),
  but millions of people collect at a hobbyist level for free.
For the PvP-oriented Trainer, there's little need to spend at all,
  especially if you live in an area with lots of PGO activity.
I have minimal Bag and Pok√©mon storage (800 and 500 respectively), and raid almost exclusively locally using the daily free pass.
Very few of my Pok√©mon have the optimal IVs for their Leagues (\autoref{chap:bounded}),
  and I don't yet have many of the Pok√©mon with which I'd like to experiment,
  yet my Great and Ultra League Elos rarely dip below 2300.
Frankly, I consider my free play a point of pride\footnote{I've spent a little less than 80 USD to date.}.
Whether one needs spend money in Pok√©mon GO is entirely a matter of goals, dedication, and patience.
With that said, if you want to spend, go with God---thanks for making my free play possible.

The calculus changes for rural Trainers.
Without local raiding (and at least four or five other Trainers to join on larger battles),
  it will be difficult to collect a diverse team of competitive Pok√©mon.
There are two alternatives: trading (\autoref{sec:trades}), which requires meeting Trainers
  already in possession of the desired Pok√©mon, and remote raiding.
Remote raiding requires passes, which require Pok√©coins---525 for 3 passes at this time.
Collecting the maximum 50 from Gyms eleven out of every fourteen days, you can do
  three free remote raids every two weeks.
You will initially be at a definite disadvantage in PvP, but one that can
  be largely overcome with cunning, and eliminated in a year's tenacious
  and savvy play.

\section{Medals}

\section{Research}
\label{sec:research}
Research is a diverse set of challenges, each with its own reward.
The Research screen is summoned up with the binoculars logo in the lower right of the Map screen.
It is broken into three tabs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Events:} Research and bonuses related to the calendar year, including ticketed research.
  \item \textbf{Today:} Field research---short-term (usually) tasks acquired by spinning Pok√©stops.
            Field research tasks can be dismissed without completion.
            Up to four field research tasks can be active at a time.
  \item \textbf{Special:} Longer-term research structuring the game's plot, so far as one exists.
    Tasks and rewards are of greater magnitude.
    Special research comes in multipart stories, where each part consists of multiple tasks.
    All tasks within a part must be completed to advance within the story.
\end{itemize}
The rewards of field research are generally on the order of Pok√©stop items---berries, balls,
 etc.---but also include encounters.
Special and Event research rewards can be quite substantial, and are the only way to acquire some Pok√©mon.
Pok√©mon met in research encounters have a higher IV floor than most spawns (\autoref{table:ivfloors}),
  and are thus disproportionately powerful for their species.
Event research includes Collection Challenges, which require the capture of a set of Pok√©mon
  within a time period, and are associated with their own medal.
