\chapter{Trainers}
Each account is defined by its associated Trainer.
A new Trainer starts at Level 1 (of 50), with 0 XP, no Stardust, no Max Particles,
 no Candy of any kind, and no Mega Energy of any kind.
They have a Bag capable of storing 350 items (not all items count against this limit),
 a Postcard Book with space for 350 Postcards,
 and capacity to hold 300 Pokémon.
Upgrades to these capacities can be purchased in units of 50.
A Trainer cannot hold Pokémon whose XP level exceeds the Trainer's
 by more than 10, i.e. a Level 22 Trainer cannot possess a Level 33
 Pokémon. If such a Pokémon is captured or otherwise received, its
 Level will be reduced to the maximum allowed.
