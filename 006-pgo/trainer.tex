\chapter{Trainers}
A Pok√©mon GO account is synonymous with its associated Trainer.

\section{Levels}
\label{sec:levels}
New Trainers start at Level 1 (of 50) with 0 XP\@.
A new Level is conferred as soon as the Trainer's XP meets or exceeds
  that Level's XP threshold (\autoref{table:xp40}).
It is possible to advance multiple Levels via a single reward of XP\@.

Certain elements of gameplay are gated by Trainer Level (\autoref{table:levelgates}),
  and a Trainer cannot control Pok√©mon whose Level exceeds the Trainer's
  by more than 10---a Level 22 Trainer will be unable to power up (\autoref{sec:plevel}) a Pok√©mon past Level 32.
Reaching a new Level is rewarded with items (\autoref{table:levelitems}).
Levels 7, 8, 15, and 20 introduce Special Research (\autoref{sec:research}).

\end{table}

All level-gated mechanics, including the ability to fully power up Pok√©mon,
 are available upon reaching Level 40\footnote{The maximum Pok√©mon Level is 50 (\autoref{chap:pokemon}).}.
Levels 43, 45, 48, and 50 provide extra Challenge quests.
Levels 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, and 50 open some cosmetic options for Trainer avatars.
Finally, Trainer Level determines the maximum level of wild spawns
  (\autoref{sec:spawns}) and the difficulty of Team GO Rocket
  opponents (\autoref{sec:rocket}).

\section{Team}
Upon reaching Level 5, a Trainer can join one of three Teams: Mystic (blue),
  Valor (red), or Instinct (yellow).
The only non-cosmetic effect of Team choice regards Gyms (\autoref{sec:gyms}), which
  are held by one Team at a time.
A Trainer can change their Team by purchasing and making use of a Team Medallion.
The cost is 1,000 Pok√©coins, and 365 days must pass between Medallion purchases.

It seems sadly impossible to join GO Rocket. Alas!

\section{Capacities}
A Trainer enters this world with no Pok√©mon, no Pok√©coins, no Stardust,
  no Max Particles, no Candy of any kind, no Mega Energy of any kind,
  no Primal Energy of any kind, no Fusion Energy of any kind, and no Crown
  Energy of any kind.
They have initial carrying capacity sufficient for 300 Pok√©mon.
Additional storage can be added in increments of 50, up to a total of 10,500.
Each upgrade costs 200 Pok√©coins.
A full upgrade will thus currently run you 40,800 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer has a Bag capable of storing 350 items (strangely, not all items
  count against this limit, including Gifts, Stickers, and the Postcard Book,
  which I suppose are shoved down the front of one's Trainer uniform).
The Bag comes with an Infinite Incubator, a Camera, 2 Incense, and 50 Pok√© Balls,
  and thus space for 296 new items.
The Bag can be upgraded to store up to 8,800 items.
Here again, each upgrade costs 200 Pok√©coins, and increases capacity by 50 items.
The maximum Bag is thus 33,800 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer has a Postcard Book with seven pages, each capable of retaining
 50 Postcards, for an inital limit of 350.
Pages can be added for 100 Pok√©coins each, up to a maximum of 40 Pages
 supporting 2,000 total Postcards.
Such a monster will cost 3,300 Pok√©coins.

The Trainer can carry up to 20 Gifts at a time. and up to 25 of each sticker.
To date, no one has found any use for the stickers.

The Trainer can accumulate no more than 9,999 units of a given Mega Energy,
 Primal Energy, or Fusion Energy.
A limit on Crown Energy is not yet known, but seems likely to be 9,999.

No limit is known for Candy nor Candy XL.
A lower bound has been established in the millions.
It seems plausible that the limit is one less than a large power of 2:
  2,147,483,647 seems as good a guess as any\footnote{If the limit is driven by UI requirements, it's likely lower.}.

\section{Grinding}
\subsection{Collecting Pok√©mon}
\label{subsec:getmons}
Pok√©mon can be received from other Trainers via trades (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  but most are captured with Pok√©balls in encounters.
An encounter involves a single subject Pok√©mon, a single Trainer,
  and possibly that Trainer's current Buddy Pok√©mon.
Outcomes (aside from certain plot-based encounters) include capture, flight of
  the Pok√©mon, and departure of the Trainer.

During the initial tour with Professor Willow, you select one of
 Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, or Pikachu to catch.
You will enter the Encounter screen, be provided an infinite supply of
  Pok√©balls for the encounter, and enjoy a catch rate (\autoref{sec:catch}) set to 100\%.

Pok√©mon will spawn on the Map screen, seemingly at random (see \autoref{sec:spawns} for details).
Pressing on them will open the Encounter screen with that Pok√©mon,
  providing an opportunity to catch it.
Encounters are also triggered by the completion of certain Research,
  defeats of Team GO Rocket, Raid wins, and Max Battle wins.
Encounters due to Research can be arbitrarily postponed by leaving the encounter screen,
  or simply not closing the research out.
Leaving wild encounters might see the Pok√©mon disappear from the Map, especially
  if you've moved significantly, or much time has gone by.
Encounters following battle wins are one-and-done; if you exit the encounter,
  that Pok√©mon is gone.

\subsection{Collecting XP}
\label{subsec:getxp}
Gaining sufficient XP advances the Trainer's level.
It is most regularly received for capturing Pok√©mon, but large awards are
  available by other means, and can be the source of a majority of a Trainer's XP.
  \textbf{FIXME}

  \caption*{Lucky Egg}
\end{wrapfigure}
Using a Lucky Egg doubles all XP awards for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Lucky Eggs can be bought from the Shop (one for 80 Pok√©coins or eight for 500),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.


\subsection{Collecting Stardust}
\label{subsec:getdust}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.4\textwidth}
  \center
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{images/stardust.png}
  \caption*{Stardust}
\end{wrapfigure}
Trainers pay a cost (partially) in Stardust
  to level up their Pok√©mon (\autoref{sec:plevel}),
  to trade them (\autoref{sec:trades}),
  to purify Shadow Pok√©mon (\autoref{sec:shadow}),
  to teach them second charged attacks (\autoref{sec:charged}),
  to change certain forms (\autoref{sec:forms}),
  and to activate Adventure Effects (\autoref{sec:effects}).
Stardust becomes the primary bottleneck on advancement fairly early in the game:
  Pok√©mon at higher levels require more Stardust to power up (\autoref{table:powerups}),
  but the amount of Stardust awarded for their capture doesn't change.
There is never enough, and one must carefully manage its use.

The primary means of acquiring Stardust is catching Pok√©mon.
The vast majority of Pok√©mon result in one of three awards based on their stage
 (\autoref{sec:evolution}), but a few offer more (\autoref{table:stardust}),
 making them excellent targets for Razz Berries.
A Pok√©mon which is weather-boosted (\autoref{sec:weather}) awards 25\% more than normal.

    \end{tabular}
  \end{centering}
  \caption{Stardust awards for capturing Pok√©mon}
  \label{table:stardust}
\end{table}
Stardust can also be collected for wins in the GO Battle League,
  opening Gifts (\autoref{sec:gifts}),
  completing Routes,
  completing Research,
  participating in Showcases,
  defeating Team Leaders in Trainer Battles,
  defeating Team GO Rocket,
  hatching eggs,
  feeding berries to Pok√©mon defending your team's Gyms,
  and from weekly Adventure Sync rewards based on the total distance walked.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.4\textwidth}

  \caption*{Star Piece}
\end{wrapfigure}
Using a Star Piece increases all Stardust awards by 50\% for thirty minutes.
During this time, a timer appears on the upper right of the map screen.
Star Pieces can be bought from the Shop (one for 100 Pok√©coins or eight for 640),
  and are sometimes awarded for completing Research.

\subsection{Collecting Candy}
\label{subsec:getcandy}
Each genus (\autoref{sec:evolution}) has its own flavor of Candy and Candy XL.
Along with Stardust, most Pok√©mon enhancement is driven by Candy.
Candy is primarily acquired by capturing Pok√©mon: each capture (in any context)
  awards Candy (and possibly Candy XL) of the capture's genus.
Three Candy are awarded for capture of a Stage 1 Pok√©mon, five for a Stage 2,
  and ten for Stage 3.
Pinap and Silver pinap berries increase this award (\autoref{sec:berries}).
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.4\textwidth}
  \center
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{images/rarecandy.png}
  \caption*{Rare Candy}
\end{wrapfigure}
A Pok√©mon can be ``transferred to the Professor'' for soul harvesting;
  its loss of existence is your gain of one tasty Candy (certain plot armored
  Pok√©mon, including Kubfu, Marshadow, and Zygarde, cannot be harvested).
Evolution consumes many Candies, but returns one when complete.

Each Rare Candy can be converted into a Candy of arbitrary flavor, and Rare Candy XL
  can likewise take on any flavor of Candy XL.

\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{FIXME}

It is possible (through Research) to receive Candy for a genus not present in
  your Pok√©dex, i.e. one whose constituent species you have never captured.
You'll keep this Candy, but it doesn't result in a Pok√©dex entry.
Likewise, Candy is retained even if all Pok√©mon of that genus have been transferred.
\subsection{Collecting Mega and Primal Energy}
The relevant Energies can be acquired by winning a Mega Raid of that type,
  walking with a Mega Evolved or Primal Reverted Buddy, and completing
  certain research tasks.
\textbf{FIXME}

\section{Medals}
\label{subsec:getmedals}
There is a large set of Medals, each of which can be achieved at the Bronze,
 Silver, Gold, or Platinum level.

\section{Pok√©dexen}
\label{sec:dexen}
The Trainer has ten Pok√©dexen\footnote{``Pok√©dexes'' to the uncultured.}:
  ``Pok√©mon'', ``Shiny'', ``XXL'', ``XXS'', ``G-Max'', ``Mega'', ``Shadow'',
  ``Purified'', ``üüâ100\%'', and ``Lucky''.
All ten start empty, and several start locked.
\textbf{FIXME details}
Entries are filled in as the relevant Pok√©mon are acquired (via any means).
Once registered, Pok√©dex entries are never unregistered.
If an entry is made in some Pok√©dex, the corresponding entry is also made
  in the primary Pok√©dex.
Shiny Shadow Pok√©mon and Shiny Purified Pok√©mon are registered to the
  ``Shiny'' Pok√©dex along with the ``Shadow'' or ``Purified'' Pok√©dex.

The Pok√©dexen have little purpose beyond pointless nostalgia.
