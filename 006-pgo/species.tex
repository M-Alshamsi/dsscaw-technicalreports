\section{Evolution}
Evolution does not necessarily preserve typing, i.e. typing is not always constant within genera.

\textbf{FIXME: table of heterogeneous genera}

\section{Shadow and Purified Pokémon}
Team Rocket uses ``Shadow'' Pokémon modified for more attack
 and less defense capability than their base forms (for more details,
 see \autoref{chap:damage}).
When captured from Team Rocket, they enter their own Shadow Pokédex.
Shadow Pokémon cost more to power up at the same Level (120\% the Stardust).
Captured Shadow Pokémon always know the Charged Attack Frustration.
Only during certain special events can this Charged Attack be replaced,
 at which time a Charged TM is required as normal.
It's a pretty terrible Charged Attack, and this really degrades the
 Shadow Pokémon until it can be replaced.
A Shadow Pokémon can be taught a second Charged Attack at any
 time, though this is also more expensive than for the normal form.
Frustration is preserved across Evolution.
