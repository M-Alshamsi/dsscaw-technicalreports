\chapter{Pokémon}
\label{chap:pokemon}
For purposes of battle, a Pokémon $P$ is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Species, possibly taking some Form
\item An ``Individual Vector'' of 3 integers from 0--15, inclusive, corresponding to ATK, DEF, and STA\@.
\item Shadow status
\item Current Hit Points. A Pokémon with zero HP has ``fainted'', and is generally unusable.
\end{itemize}
Visual presentation does not affect battle.
Hit Points are carried across PvE battles, but Trainer Battles always start
 with full HP\@.
Fainted Pokémon cannot be used in battles of any kind.

\section{Pokémon Level}
Powering up a fainted Pokémon will revive it, but with minimal HP\@:

\[ HP = \min{1, MHP_{New} - MHP_{Old} } \]
