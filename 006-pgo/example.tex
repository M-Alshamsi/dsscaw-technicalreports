\chapter{A worked example of team selection}
\label{chap:example}

Let's consider the Fossil Cup of summer 2025, which began while I was writing this book.
Like the Great League, the Fossil Cup has a CP1500 bound, and it
  restricts participants to those with Rock, Steel, or Water in their typings.
Largely off vibes, I had been primarily playing the following team, and doing alright
  one hundred matches in (despite having far from optimal IVs):
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    Pokémon & IV@Level (CP) & $Eff_A$ & $Eff_D$ & MHP & $\sqrt[3]{BP}$\\
    Greninja & 15/14/12@20 (1500) & 142.18 & 99.17 & 112 & 115.27 \\
    Magcargo & 15/13/12@32.5 (1497) & 115.01 & 152.35 & 111 & 124.82 \\
    Gastrodon & 0/3/15@25.5 (1495) & 114.01 & 98.49 & 174 & 125.01 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
With the following attacks:
\begin{center}
Water Shuriken, Hydro Cannon, Night Slash
Incinerate, Overheat, Stone Edge
  Mud-Slap, Earth Power, Body Slam \textbf{FIXME}
\end{center}
How could I improve?

\section{Boosting the numbers}
Without changing my choice of species, the following configurations were desirable when optimizing for $\sqrt[3]{BP}$:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llrrrr}
    Pokémon & IV@Level (CP) & $Eff_A$ & $Eff_D$ & MHP & $\sqrt[3]{BP}$\\
    Greninja & 3/15/12@20 (1500) & 138.35 & 102.23 & 115 & 117.60\\
    Magcargo & 0/15/14@38.5 (1498) & 108.67 & 161.05 & 118 & 127.34\\
    Gastrodon & 1/15/14@24.5 (1500) & 112.41 & 104.47 & 170 & 125.92\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Of course, it's impossible to modify IVs.
Even if I could, the benefits are meager: a 2.02\% increase for Greninja,
  2.02\% to Magcargo, and a mere 0.73\% for Gastrodon, all of it coming
  in defense and HP at the expense of a bit of attack.
The means themselves are unspectacular, but not bad; Gastrodon and Magcargo are up there
  in the thick of things, and we'll see below that Greninja has a great moveset.

\section{Covering the typings}
This limits teams to 51 of the 171 typings (29.8\%): the three monotypes, seventeen dualtypes
 involving Rock, sixteen dualtypes involving Steel (we already counted Rock+Steel), and
 fifteen dualtypes involving Water (we already counted Rock+Water and Steel+Water).
Consulting \autoref{table:defenders}, we see these 51 typings populated by 267 total Pokémon.
The biggest typing by far is pure Water, with 66.
Four typings are unpopulated: Fire+Water, Normal+Steel, Normal+Rock, and Ghost+Rock.

As noted in \autoref{sec:typeleagues}, there exist two minimal coverings of the forty-seven
  remaining typings, each of size six:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c}
 Bug, Fairy, Fire, Grass, Ground, Rock\\
 Bug, Dragon, Fire, Grass, Ground, Rock\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
