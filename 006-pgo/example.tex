\chapter{A worked example of team selection}
\label{chap:example}

Let's consider the Fossil Cup of summer 2025, which began while I was writing this book.
The Fossil Cup has a CP1500 bound, like the Great League.
It furthermore restricts participants to those with Rock, Steel, or Water in their typings.
This limits teams to 51 of the 171 typings (29.8\%): the three monotypes, seventeen dualtypes
 involving Rock, sixteen dualtypes involving Steel (we already counted Rock+Steel), and
 fifteen dualtypes involving Water (we already counted Rock+Water and Steel+Water).
Consulting \autoref{table:defenders}, we see these 51 typings populated by 267 total Pok√©mon.
The biggest typing by far is pure Water, with 66.
Four typings are unpopulated: Fire+Water, Normal+Steel, Normal+Rock, and Ghost+Rock.
