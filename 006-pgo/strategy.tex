\label{chap:strategy}
One of the greatest advantages one can gain is knowledge.
Know Pokémon well, especially those on your team and those you regularly see.
Know what moves they can learn, and how hard they throw them (Power and $Eff_A$).
Knowing their bulk ($Eff_D$ times MHP) can help decide which charged attack to use.
Know type relations cold, and be able to calculate type effectiveness on the fly.
The flipside of this is exploitation of ignorance.
Opposing Trainers are less likely to know Pokémon outside the ``meta'',
 especially those with uncommon typings.
A Pokémon can only know two charged attacks at a time, but if
 chosen from a move pool of three or more charged, even an informed opponent
 can't know what's coming until it's thrown.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,title=A Tip regarding battle UI,halign title=flush center]
Without sufficient energy, pressing the charged attack control causes a fast
 attack to be thrown.
If you know you want to throw a charged attack as soon as possible, just press
 its control until thrown.
\end{tcolorbox}

Having two charged attacks is a tremendous advantage over only one.
If they are different types, you can gain type advantage over a wide range of opponents.
Since you choose which one to throw on the fly, resistances are much less of a concern.
\textbf{FIXME}

Change to Damage inflicted by an effective Attack is at least 60\%.
Change to Damage inflicted by an ineffective Attack may be as
 low as 37.5\%.
It is probably worth accepting an ineffective Fast Attack if it
 enables an effective Charged Attack, so long as you actually
 get that Charged Attack off.
Early in the battle, this might trick the opponent into leaving
 off a Shield, allowing a \textbf{FIXME}.
