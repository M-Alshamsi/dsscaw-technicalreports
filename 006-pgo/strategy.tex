\label{chap:strategy}

Having two charged attacks is a tremendous advantage over only one.
If they are different types, you can gain type advantage over a wide
 range of opponents.
Since you choose which one to throw on the fly, weaknesses are
 much less of a concern (so long as the two types share no
 weaknesses, you ought never need throw an ineffective
 charged attack---at worst, you'll have no effective option).
