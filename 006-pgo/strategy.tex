\label{chap:strategy}

Having two charged attacks is a tremendous advantage over only one.
If they are different types, you can gain type advantage over a wide
 range of opponents.
Since you choose which one to throw on the fly, weaknesses are
 much less of a concern (so long as the two types share no
 weaknesses, you ought never need throw an ineffective
 charged attack---at worst, you'll have no effective option).
\textbf{FIXME}

Change to Damage inflicted by an effective Attack is at least 60\%.
Change to Damage inflicted by an ineffective Attack may be as
 low as 37.5\%.
It is probably worth accepting an ineffective Fast Attack if it
 enables an effective Charged Attack, so long as you actually
 get that Charged Attack off.
Early in the battle, this might trick the opponent into leaving
 off a Shield, allowing a \textbf{FIXME}.
