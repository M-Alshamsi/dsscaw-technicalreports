\chapter{Basic stats}

We'll derive some statistics from each Pokémon.
These values are used as inputs to battle mechanics.
First, sum the Species's ATK, DEF, and STA with the Pokémon's
 IVs to generate $Mod_A$, $Mod_D$, and $Mod_S$:

 \[ Mod_A = ATK + IV_A \]
 \[ Mod_D = DEF + IV_D \]
 \[ Mod_S = STA + IV_S \]

These values are typically scaled by the Pokémon's Combat Power Multiplier.

\section{Combat Power Multiplier}
Recall that each Pokémon has its own Level, ranging from 1.0
 to 50.0, defined on half integers.
This Level is used as an index into a table of rational,
 positive constants.
The value accessed is that Pokémon's Combat Power Multiplier (CPM).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}
Level & CPM & Level & CPM & Level & CPM \\
\Midrule
1.0 & 0.094 & 17.5 & 0.558830576 & 33.0 & 0.74976104 \\
1.5 & 0.135137432 & 18.0 & 0.56675452 & 33.5 & 0.752729087 \\
2.0 & 0.16639787 & 18.5 & 0.574569153 & 34.0 & 0.75568551 \\
17.0 & 0.55079269 & 32.5 & 0.746781211 & 50.0 & 0.84030001 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Combat Power Multiplier by half-level}
\label{table:cpm}
\end{table}


We multiply each of the $Mod$ values by CPM to generate $Eff_A$, $Eff_D$, and $EFF_S$:
\[ Eff_A = Mod_A \times CPM \]
\[ Eff_D = Mod_D \times CPM \]
\[ Eff_S = Mod_S \times CPM \]

\section{$Eff_A$, $Eff_D$, and MHP}
$Eff_S$ determines the Pokémon's Maximum Hit Points (MHP).
When a Pokémon's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is knocked out, and cannot be
 used (nor made a Buddy) until revived.
Hit Points are persistent across Raids, Max Battles, and Team Rocket encounters,
 and can be restored (up to MHP) with Potions.
MHP is defined such that it is always a positive integer:
\[ MHP = \min{1, \lfloor Eff_S \rfloor} \]
