\label{chap:simul}

It is not believed that simple closed form solutions exist describing
 the set of reasonable games between two arbitrary opponents (see \autoref{chap:unbounded}),
 let alone two teams.
For the highest level of predictive power, we must turn to machine-aided simulation.
Here we are lucky, for unlike most contests, Pok√©mon GO is concretely finite and discrete.
Its time evolves in half-second turns, each of which presents a small number of choices
  to both Trainers.
The use of random numbers is furthermore minimal.
Finally, it never diverges, instead advancing always towards a conclusion.
It is thus feasible to exhaustively simulate matches, examining every possible choice
  a Trainer might make, and the results.
